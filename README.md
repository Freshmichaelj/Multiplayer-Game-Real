# MyProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# Multiplayer-Game-Real
# Welome to the game boys, to start, download Unreal Engine 5 (ue5) from the Epic Launcher.
# Then from there CLONE the files that are in the MAIN Branch, this branch will be all of the content we've done individually.
# For example, I have done the animations, cyle will be doing something, Hassan will be doing. You PUSH into YOUR Branch, I will review them and if good, I can accept the changes that you have made with the game and can then PUSH into MAIN which will combine all of our files into one file. 
# Please watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3x1fErlmYA this youtube video to under how to PUSH, COMMIT, PULL, COMMENT, ETC.
# Let's making something Amazing, love you boys.
